# SortingAlgo_Visualizer
we have created a Sorting Visualizer project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSX, and React JS. 
This project showcases our proficiency in front-end web development and my ability to leverage
React JS to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces.

The Sorting Visualizer project is a web application that allows users to visualize various sorting algorithms 
in action, including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.
Through this project, we were  to gain a deeper understanding of front-end web development and further hone my skills in React JS.
